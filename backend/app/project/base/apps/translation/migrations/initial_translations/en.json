  "storyOfNaanu1": "I became vegan after watching a documentary called {cowspiracy} by {kipAndersen}. Health issues raised in that movie related to the consumption of meat were convincing enough for me to switch diets. On top of that I read {comfortablyUnaware} a book by {oppenlander} and learnt what {klaper}, a physician, had to say about plant-based diets compared to meat based diets ({aboutMilk}) and their effects on the environment and the sustainability of the planet. There are of course a multitude of {reasoning}.",
  "storyOfNaanu2": "After doing some more research, I was convinced of the {healthBenefits} and knew it would be better for the {sustainability}.",
  "storyOfNaanu3": "What I wasn’t expecting at this point was all the possible deficiencies that a plant-based diet would bring. The easiest solution of course to overcome {possibleDeficiencies} is to take supplements in the form of pills. This is where my annoyance began. I personally hate taking pills and rarely reach for chemically made medication. The very few times I make myself swallow pills is when I’m trying to overcome a migraine.",
  "storyOfNaanu4": "At the same time, I have always had a sweet tooth and love chocolatey things. But once I became vegan I think there was probably more than 99% of the sweet things on the shelf at a grocery store that were not vegan. The few sweet vegan things that exist contain palm oil and/ or are wrapped in plastic packaging! These limited options really bothered me and I often made Chocolate Chip Cookies by substituting non-vegan ingredients with plant-based alternatives.",
  "storyOfNaanu5": "This is when the idea first came to mind. I believe in “let food be thy medicine” by Hippocrates. So, there must be a way of a) getting all nutrients from natural and vegan sources and b) being able to enjoy taking supplements! Now that I had the idea of something edible that is vegan, how would I get all the nutrients in there and how was I going to figure out if other people also would want something like this? I joined the Founder Institute, a program that helps people with ideas start business and that’s where it all began. You can read about how {naanuStarted} on our Blog.",
